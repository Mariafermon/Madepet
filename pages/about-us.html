                    <h2>Mary and Lisa</h2>
                    <p>Maria and Ana. They have been best friends since childhood and have always shared a love for animals. When they graduated from college, they decided to move in together and adopt a cute little dog named Max.
        
                        As pet owners, they faced a common problem - finding reliable and trustworthy professionals for Max's care when they were busy with work or out of town. They realized that other pet owners might be facing the same issue and wanted to do something to help.
                        
                        That's when they came up with the idea for Madepet - a platform that would connect pet owners with the best professionals for their pets' needs. With their shared passion for animals and their complementary skills in business and technology, Maria and Ana were the perfect team to bring this idea to life.
                        
                        Today, Madepet has grown into a thriving community of pet owners and professionals who share a love for animals and a commitment to their well-being. Maria and Ana are proud of what they have achieved and are constantly working to improve the platform and make pet care easier and more accessible for everyone.</p>
